### Excersise 2: Clean green fields project

> As an enthusiastic card player and developer</br>
I want to create a program to play cards against the computer</br>
So that when I am bored I can play some card games against an intelligent opponent.

At this stage I am unsure of what UI to build for, 
web, native, console or what card game I should code for (I'll figure that out later).

At this stage I know I need a concept of a Deck, Cards and a Shuffle function.
